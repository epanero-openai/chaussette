# Chaussette

Chaussette is a proxy which takes SOCKS5 requests and proxies them to CONNECT 
over HTTP. It is designed for use with [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com) 
services which support 
[CONNECT over HTTP](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110#section-9.3.6) 
such as the [Privacy Edge proxies](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-gb/lp/privacy-edge/). 
Chaussette will also allow the passing of a 
[GeoHash hint](https://www.ietf.org/archive/id/draft-geohash-hint-00.html)
which will instruct the Cloudflare privacy proxy into which geography the 
requests proxied by Chaussette should egress. 


Getting Started
---------------

The proxy takes in some configuration from the command line, and some configuration
from Environent Variables. 

Usage
```
chaussette [OPTIONS] --listen-addr <LISTEN_ADDR> [MASQUE_PRESHARED_KEY] [CLIENT_CERT] [CLIENT_KEY]
```

To run with a Preshared Key with no mTLS listening on port 1987 and presenting the 
Geohash xn76cvs0-JP:

```
MASQUE_PRESHARED_KEY=1234 cargo run -- --listen 127.0.0.1:1987 --proxy 
https://host.of.proxy:443 --geohash xn76cvs0-JP
```

Switches
--------
```
--help
```
Prints the help file

```
--listen
```
The local IP and port to listen for SOCKS5 connections on in format IP:PORT. 

```
--proxy
```
The protocol, host and port of the `privacy proxy` to make CONNECT over HTTP requests 
to in the format https://IP:PORT

```
--geohash
```
The Geohash to supply with any requests

```
--timeout
```
The timeout value of a request, specified in seconds. 
If omitted, Chaussette does not impose a local request timeout.

```
--http2-keepalive-interval
```
The number of seconds between HTTP/2 PING frames. Supplying this option together
with `--http2-keepalive-timeout` enables keepalive while idle and eager recovery
of the shared HTTP/2 proxy connection.

```
--http2-keepalive-timeout
```
The number of seconds to wait for an HTTP/2 PING acknowledgement before closing
and eagerly re-establishing the shared proxy connection. This option requires
`--http2-keepalive-interval`.

```
--proxy_ca
```
If set, do not use the system CA trust store and specify a file in PEM format
containing a `proxy` CA to trust, 

Environment Variables
---------------------

```
MASQUE_PRESHARED_KEY
```
If set, chaussette will supply `Proxy-Authorization: Preshared VALUE` on any HTTP 
request to the `proxy`. It can also be set using the `MASQUE_PRESHARED_KEY` env var.

```
CLIENT_CERT
```
If mutual TLS is used to authenticate to the `proxy` this specifies the client_cert 
to present on the CONNECT request. The Env Var should be populated with the PEM data

```
CLIENT_KEY
```
If mutual TLS is used to authenticate to the `proxy` this specifies the key to use 
for the certificate contained in `CLIENT_CERT`. The Env Var should be populated with 
the PEM data
